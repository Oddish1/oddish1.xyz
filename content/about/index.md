title: About Me
---
I am currently a computer science student studying at Maryville University with concentrations in both data science and software development.

In my free time I like to learn about programming, self-host different applications like Nextcloud, Plex, Navidrome, etc. I also like to cook, play video games, and listen to music. My favorite video game is probably either Rim World or Minecraft, but I like many different types of games. Lately I have been enjoying more indie games than AAA games.

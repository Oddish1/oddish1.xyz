      <description>I am currently a computer science student studying at Maryville University with concentrations in both data science and software development.
In my free time I like to learn about programming, self-host different applications like Nextcloud, Plex, Navidrome, etc. I also like to cook, play video games, and listen to music. My favorite video game is probably either Rim World or Minecraft, but I like many different types of games. Lately I have been enjoying more indie games than AAA games.</description>

      <description>Hello, World!
Welcome to my brand new website that I am running using a really simple tool called Hugo. For those of you who may not know, Hugo is one of the most popular static site generators. It turns simple plain-text markdown into great looking webpages, and allows for customization from the basic of changing themes, to full on customization depending on your skill-level.
What to Expect Over time, I will be sharing a mix of tutorials, personal stories, insights, and anything that inspires me to write a new post.</description>

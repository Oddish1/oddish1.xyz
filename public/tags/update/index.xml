      <description>Hello, World!
Welcome to my brand new website that I am running using a really simple tool called Hugo. For those of you who may not know, Hugo is one of the most popular static site generators. It turns simple plain-text markdown into great looking webpages, and allows for customization from the basic of changing themes, to full on customization depending on your skill-level.
What to Expect Over time, I will be sharing a mix of tutorials, personal stories, insights, and anything that inspires me to write a new post.</description>
